Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
	PRINT first number
ELSE 
	PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET total to zero
REPEAT

	COUNT number
	IF number <= 100
		INCREMENT number by 1
	END IF

UNTIL number = 100
PRINT number 

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT entry
SEQUENCE entry in directory
IF entry = directory.entry
print directory

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function (name) {
for (i = 0; i < directory.length; i++) 
if (name = directory.name)
print name
};
