Exercises

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Searching through each name in a phone book until you find the specific entry and you are looking for.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Searching through an alphabetized rolodex for a specific contacts information. 

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: It would take seven iterations to locate the letter G in the alphabetized list.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: It would only require three iterations since the first search would elminiate the letters from A-D, the second would remove E & F, and the final iteration would end with the letter G.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Since the collection is unsorted the linear search would be more efficient. A binary search would require the items to be sorted.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: In this case the Binary search would be much more efficient since the list is sorted it could eliminate the majority of the redundancy while also moving down the list at a faster rate than a linear search.

Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A: 
function binarySearch (array, word) {
  let left = 0
  let right = array.length -1
  if (word < array[left] || word > array[right]) {
    return null
  }
  while(left <=right) {
    let middle = Math.floor ((left + right)/2)
    if (array[middle] === word) {
      return middle
    } else if (array[middle] < word) {
      left = middle + 1
    } else {
      right = middle - 1
    }
  }
  return null
}

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A: 
function findFish(collection , fish) {
  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
    if (collection[i] == fish) {
      console.log('I found it!')
      return collection[i];
    }
  }
  console.log("Sorry I'll try again")
  return -1
}
